## class nvvk::AppBaseVk

nvvk::AppBaseVk is used in a few samples, can serve as base class for various needs.
They might differ a bit in setup and functionality, but in principle aid the setup of context and window,
as well as some common event processing.

The nvvk::AppBaseVk serves as the base class for many ray tracing examples and makes use of the Vulkan C API.
It does the basics for Vulkan, by holding a reference to the instance and device, but also comes with optional default setups 
for the render passes and the swapchain.

### Usage

An example will derive from this class:

``` c++
class VkSample : public AppBaseVk 
{
};
```

### Setup

In the `main()` of an application,  call `setup()` which is taking a Vulkan instance, device, physical device, 
and a queue family index.  Setup copies the given Vulkan handles into AppBase, and query the 0th VkQueue of the 
specified family, which must support graphics operations and drawing to the surface passed to createSurface.
Furthermore, it is creating a VkCommandPool.

Prior to calling setup, if you are using the `nvvk::Context` class to create and initialize Vulkan instances,
you may want to create a VkSurfaceKHR from the window (glfw for example) and call `setGCTQueueWithPresent()`.
This will make sure the m_queueGCT queue of nvvk::Context can draw to the surface, and m_queueGCT.familyIndex 
will meet the requirements of setup().

Creating the swapchain for displaying. Arguments are
width and height, color and depth format, and vsync on/off. Defaults will create the best format for the surface.

Creating framebuffers has a dependency on the renderPass and depth buffer. All those are virtual and can be overridden
in a sample, but default implementation exist.

- createDepthBuffer: creates a 2D depth/stencil image
- createRenderPass : creates a color/depth pass and clear both buffers.

Here is the dependency order:

``` c++
  vkSample.createDepthBuffer();
  vkSample.createRenderPass();
  vkSample.createFrameBuffers();
```


The nvvk::Swapchain will create n images, typically 3. With this information, AppBase is also creating 3 VkFence, 
3 VkCommandBuffer and 3 VkFrameBuffer.

#### Frame Buffers

The created frame buffers are *display* frame buffers,  made to be presented on screen. The frame buffers will be created 
using one of the images from swapchain, and a depth buffer. There is only one depth buffer because that resource is not 
used simultaneously. For example, when we clear the depth buffer, it is not done immediately, but done through a command 
buffer, which will be executed later. 


**Note**: the imageView(s) are part of the swapchain. 

#### Command Buffers

AppBase works with 3 *frame command buffers*. Each frame is filling a command buffer and gets submitted, one after the 
other. This is a design choice that can be debated, but makes it simple. I think it is still possible to submit other 
command buffers in a frame, but those command buffers will have to be submitted before the *frame* one. The *frame* 
command buffer when submitted with submitFrame, will use the current fence.

#### Fences

There are as many fences as there are images in the swapchain. At the beginning of a frame, we call prepareFrame(). 
This is calling the acquire() from nvvk::SwapChain and wait until the image is available. The very first time, the 
fence will not stop, but later it will wait until the submit is completed on the GPU. 



### ImGui

If the application is using Dear ImGui, there are convenient functions for initializing it and
setting the callbacks (glfw). The first one to call is `initGUI(0)`, where the argument is the subpass
it will be using. Default is 0, but if the application creates a renderpass with multi-sampling and
resolves in the second subpass, this makes it possible.

### Glfw Callbacks

Call `setupGlfwCallbacks(window)` to have all the window callback: key, mouse, window resizing.
By default AppBase will handle resizing of the window and will recreate the images and framebuffers. 
If a sample needs to be aware of the resize, it can implement `onResize(width, height)`.

To handle the callbacks in Imgui, call `ImGui_ImplGlfw_InitForVulkan(window, true)`, where true 
will handle the default ImGui callback .

**Note**: All the methods are virtual and can be overloaded if they are not doing the typical setup. 

``` c++
  // Create example
  VulkanSample vkSample;

  // Window need to be opened to get the surface on which to draw
  const VkSurfaceKHR surface = vkSample.getVkSurface(vkctx.m_instance, window);
  vkctx.setGCTQueueWithPresent(surface);

  vkSample.setup(vkctx.m_instance, vkctx.m_device, vkctx.m_physicalDevice, vkctx.m_queueGCT.familyIndex);
  vkSample.createSwapchain(surface, SAMPLE_WIDTH, SAMPLE_HEIGHT);
  vkSample.createDepthBuffer();
  vkSample.createRenderPass();
  vkSample.createFrameBuffers();
  vkSample.initGUI(0);
  vkSample.setupGlfwCallbacks(window);
  
  ImGui_ImplGlfw_InitForVulkan(window, true);
```

### Drawing loop

The drawing loop in the main() is the typicall loop you will find in glfw examples. Note that
AppBase has a convenient function to tell if the window is minimize, therefore not doing any 
work and contain a sleep(), so the CPU is not going crazy. 


``` c++
// Window system loop
while(!glfwWindowShouldClose(window))
{
  glfwPollEvents();
  if(vkSample.isMinimized())
    continue;

  vkSample.display();  // infinitely drawing
}
```

### Display

A typical display() function will need the following: 

* Acquiring the next image: `prepareFrame()`
* Get the command buffer for the frame. There are n command buffers equal to the number of in-flight frames.
* Clearing values
* Start rendering pass
* Drawing
* End rendering
* Submitting frame to display

``` c++
void VkSample::display()
{
  // Acquire 
  prepareFrame();

  // Command buffer for current frame
  auto                   curFrame = getCurFrame();
  const VkCommandBuffer& cmdBuf   = getCommandBuffers()[curFrame];

  VkCommandBufferBeginInfo beginInfo{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_COMMAND_BUFFER_BEGIN_INFO};
  beginInfo.flags = VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_ONE_TIME_SUBMIT_BIT;
  vkBeginCommandBuffer(cmdBuf, &beginInfo);

  // Clearing values
  std::array<VkClearValue, 2> clearValues{};
  clearValues[0].color        = {{1.f, 1.f, 1.f, 1.f}};
  clearValues[1].depthStencil = {1.0f, 0};

  // Begin rendering
  VkRenderPassBeginInfo renderPassBeginInfo{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_RENDER_PASS_BEGIN_INFO};
  renderPassBeginInfo.clearValueCount = 2;
  renderPassBeginInfo.pClearValues    = clearValues.data();
  renderPassBeginInfo.renderPass      = m_renderPass;
  renderPassBeginInfo.framebuffer     = m_framebuffers[curFram];
  renderPassBeginInfo.renderArea      = {{0, 0}, m_size};
  vkCmdBeginRenderPass(cmdBuf, &renderPassBeginInfo, VK_SUBPASS_CONTENTS_SECONDARY_COMMAND_BUFFERS);

  
  // .. draw scene ...

  // Draw UI
  ImGui_ImplVulkan_RenderDrawData( ImGui::GetDrawData(),cmdBuff)

  // End rendering
  vkCmdEndRenderPass(cmdBuf);

  // End of the frame and present the one which is ready
  vkEndCommandBuffer(cmdBuf);
  submitFrame();
}
```

### Closing

Finally, all resources can be destroyed by calling `destroy()` at the end of main().

``` c++
  vkSample.destroy();
```

## class nvvk::AppBase

nvvk::AppBaseVk is the same as nvvk::AppBaseVk but makes use of the Vulkan C++ API (`vulkan.hpp`).

# appwindowprofiler_vk.hpp

<a name="appwindowprofiler_vkhpp"></a>
## class nvvk::AppWindowProfilerVK

nvvk::AppWindowProfilerVK derives from nvh::AppWindowProfiler
and overrides the context and swapbuffer functions.
The nvh class itself provides several utilities and 
command line options to run automated benchmarks etc.

To influence the vulkan instance/device creation modify 
`m_contextInfo` prior running AppWindowProfiler::run,
which triggers instance, device, window, swapchain creation etc.

The class comes with a nvvk::ProfilerVK instance that references the 
AppWindowProfiler::m_profiler's data.

# buffersuballocator_vk.hpp

<a name="buffersuballocator_vkhpp"></a>
## class nvvk::BufferSubAllocator

nvvk::BufferSubAllocator provides buffer sub allocation using larger buffer blocks.
The blocks are one VkBuffer each and are allocated via the 
provided [nvvk::MemAllocator](#class-nvvkmemallocator).

The requested buffer space is sub-allocated and recycled in blocks internally.
This way we avoid creating lots of small VkBuffers and can avoid calling the Vulkan
API at all, when there are blocks with sufficient empty space. 
While Vulkan is more efficient than previous APIs, creating lots
of objects for it, is still not good for overall performance. It will result 
into more cache misses and use more system memory over all.

Be aware that each sub-allocation is always BASE_ALIGNMENT aligned.
A custom alignment during allocation can be requested, it will ensure
that the returned sub-allocation range of offset & size can account for 
the original requested size fitting within and respecting the requested

This, however, means the regular offset and may not match the requested 
alignment, and the regular size can be bigger to account for the shift
caused by manual alignment.

It is therefore necessary to pass the alignment that was used at allocation time
to the query functions as well.

``` c++
// alignment <= BASE_ALIGNMENT
    handle  = subAllocator.subAllocate(size);
    binding = subAllocator.getSubBinding(handle);

// alignment > BASE_ALIGNMENT
    handle  = subAllocator.subAllocate(size, alignment);
    binding = subAllocator.getSubBinding(handle, alignment);
```

# buffers_vk.hpp

<a name="buffers_vkhpp"></a>
## functions in nvvk

- makeBufferCreateInfo : wraps setup of VkBufferCreateInfo (implicitly sets VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT)
- makeBufferViewCreateInfo : wraps setup of VkBufferViewCreateInfo
- createBuffer : wraps vkCreateBuffer
- createBufferView : wraps vkCreateBufferView
- getBufferDeviceAddressKHR : wraps vkGetBufferDeviceAddressKHR
- getBufferDeviceAddress : wraps vkGetBufferDeviceAddress

``` c++
VkBufferCreateInfo bufferCreate = makeBufferCreateInfo (size, VK_BUFFER_USAGE_UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER_BIT);
VkBuffer buffer                 = createBuffer(device, bufferCreate);
VkBufferView bufferView         = createBufferView(device, makeBufferViewCreateInfo(buffer, VK_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM, size));
```



_____

# commands_vk.hpp

<a name="commands_vkhpp"></a>
## functions in nvvk

- makeAccessMaskPipelineStageFlags : depending on accessMask returns appropriate VkPipelineStageFlagBits
- cmdBegin : wraps vkBeginCommandBuffer with VkCommandBufferUsageFlags and implicitly handles VkCommandBufferBeginInfo setup
- makeSubmitInfo : VkSubmitInfo struct setup using provided arrays of signals and commandbuffers, leaving rest zeroed



## class nvvk::CommandPool

nvvk::CommandPool stores a single VkCommandPool and provides utility functions
to create VkCommandBuffers from it.

Example:
``` c++
{
  nvvk::CommandPool cmdPool;
  cmdPool.init(...);

  // some setup/one shot work
  {
    vkCommandBuffer cmd = scopePool.createAndBegin();
    ... record commands ...
    // trigger execution with a blocking operation
    // not recommended for performance
    // but useful for sample setup
    scopePool.submitAndWait(cmd, queue);
  }

  // other cmds you may batch, or recycle
  std::vector<VkCommandBuffer> cmds;
  {
    vkCommandBuffer cmd = scopePool.createAndBegin();
    ... record commands ...
    cmds.push_back(cmd);
  }
  {
    vkCommandBuffer cmd = scopePool.createAndBegin();
    ... record commands ...
    cmds.push_back(cmd);
  }

  // do some form of batched submission of cmds

  // after completion destroy cmd
  cmdPool.destroy(cmds.size(), cmds.data());
  cmdPool.deinit();
}
```



## class nvvk::ScopeCommandBuffer

nvvk::ScopeCommandBuffer provides a single VkCommandBuffer that lives within the scope
and is directly submitted and deleted when the scope is left.
Not recommended for efficiency, since it results in a blocking
operation, but aids sample writing.

Example:
``` c++
{
  ScopeCommandBuffer cmd(device, queueFamilyIndex, queue);
  ... do stuff
  vkCmdCopyBuffer(cmd, ...);
}
```



## class nvvk::RingFences

  nvvk::RingFences recycles a fixed number of fences, provides information in which cycle
  we are currently at, and prevents accidental access to a cycle in-flight.

  A typical frame would start by "setCycleAndWait", which waits for the
  requested cycle to be available.



## class nvvk::RingCommandPool

  nvvk::RingCommandPool manages a fixed cycle set of VkCommandBufferPools and
  one-shot command buffers allocated from them.

  The usage of multiple command buffer pools also means we get nice allocation
  behavior (linear allocation from frame start to frame end) without fragmentation.
  If we were using a single command pool over multiple frames, it could fragment easily.

  You must ensure cycle is available manually, typically by keeping in sync
  with ring fences.

  Example:

  ``` c++
  {
    frame++;

    // wait until we can use the new cycle 
    // (very rare if we use the fence at then end once per-frame)
    ringFences.setCycleAndWait( frame );

    // update cycle state, allows recycling of old resources
    ringPool.setCycle( frame );

    VkCommandBuffer cmd = ringPool.createCommandBuffer(...);
    ... do stuff / submit etc...

    VkFence fence = ringFences.getFence();
    // use this fence in the submit
    vkQueueSubmit(...fence..);
  }
  ```



## class nvvk::BatchSubmission

nvvk::BatchSubmission batches the submission arguments of VkSubmitInfo for VkQueueSubmit.

vkQueueSubmit is a rather costly operation (depending on OS)
and should be avoided to be done too often (e.g. < 10 per frame). Therefore 
this utility class allows adding commandbuffers, semaphores etc. and
submit them later in a batch.

When using manual locks, it can also be useful to feed commandbuffers
from different threads and then later kick it off.

Example

``` c++
  // within upload logic
  {
    semTransfer = handleUpload(...);
    // for example trigger async upload on transfer queue here
    vkQueueSubmit(... semTransfer ...);

    // tell next frame's batch submission 
    // that its commandbuffers should wait for transfer
    // to be completed
    graphicsSubmission.enqueWait(semTransfer)
  }

  // within present logic
  {
    // for example ensure the next frame waits until proper present semaphore was triggered
    graphicsSubmission.enqueueWait(presentSemaphore);
  }

  // within drawing logic
  {
    // enqueue some graphics work for submission
    graphicsSubmission.enqueue(getSceneCmdBuffer());
    graphicsSubmission.enqueue(getUiCmdBuffer());

    graphicsSubmission.execute(frameFence);
  }
```



## class nvvk::FencedCommandPools

nvvk::FencedCommandPools container class contains the typical utilities to handle
command submission. It contains RingFences, RingCommandPool and BatchSubmission
with a convenient interface.

# context_vk.hpp

<a name="context_vkhpp"></a>
## class nvvk::Context

nvvk::Context class helps creating the Vulkan instance and to choose the logical device for the mandatory extensions. First is to fill the `ContextCreateInfo` structure, then call:

``` c++
  // Creating the Vulkan instance and device
  nvvk::ContextCreateInfo ctxInfo;
  ... see above ...

  nvvk::Context vkctx;
  vkctx.init(ctxInfo);

  // after init the ctxInfo is no longer needed
``` 

At this point, the class will have created the `VkInstance` and `VkDevice` according to the information passed. It will also keeps track or have query the information of:
 
* Physical Device information that you can later query : `PhysicalDeviceInfo` in which lots of `VkPhysicalDevice...` are stored
* `VkInstance` : the one instance being used for the program
* `VkPhysicalDevice` : physical device(s) used for the logical device creation. In case of more than one physical device, we have a std::vector for this purpose...
* `VkDevice` : the logical device instantiated
* `VkQueue` : By default, 3 queues are created, one per family: Graphic-Compute-Transfer, Compute and Transfer.
              For any additionnal queue, they need to be requested with `ContextCreateInfo::addRequestedQueue()`. This is creating information of the best suitable queues,
              but not creating them. To create the additional queues, 
              `Context::createQueue()` **must be call after** creating the Vulkan context.
              </br>The following queues are always created and can be directly accessed without calling createQueue :
   * `Queue m_queueGCT` : Graphics/Compute/Transfer Queue + family index
   * `Queue m_queueT` : async Transfer Queue + family index
   * `Queue m_queueC` : async Compute Queue + family index
* maintains what extensions are finally available
* implicitly hooks up the debug callback

### Choosing the device
When there are multiple devices, the `init` method is choosing the first compatible device available, but it is also possible the choose another one.
``` c++
  vkctx.initInstance(deviceInfo); 
  // Find all compatible devices
  auto compatibleDevices = vkctx.getCompatibleDevices(deviceInfo);
  assert(!compatibleDevices.empty());

  // Use first compatible device
  vkctx.initDevice(compatibleDevices[0], deviceInfo);
```

### Multi-GPU

When multiple graphic cards should be used as a single device, the `ContextCreateInfo::useDeviceGroups` need to be set to `true`.
The above methods will transparently create the `VkDevice` using `VkDeviceGroupDeviceCreateInfo`.
Especially in the context of NVLink connected cards this is useful.

# debug_util_vk.hpp

<a name="debug_util_vkhpp"></a>
## class DebugUtil

# descriptorsets_vk.hpp

<a name="descriptorsets_vkhpp"></a>
## functions in nvvk

- createDescriptorPool : wrappers for vkCreateDescriptorPool
- allocateDescriptorSet : allocates a single VkDescriptorSet
- allocateDescriptorSets : allocates multiple VkDescriptorSets




## class nvvk::DescriptorSetBindings

nvvk::DescriptorSetBindings is a helper class that keeps a vector of `VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding` for a single
`VkDescriptorSetLayout`. Provides helper functions to create `VkDescriptorSetLayout`
as well as `VkDescriptorPool` based on this information, as well as utilities
to fill the `VkWriteDescriptorSet` structure with binding information stored
within the class.

The class comes with the convenience functionality that when you make a
VkWriteDescriptorSet you provide the binding slot, rather than the
index of the binding's storage within this class. This results in a small
linear search, but makes it easy to change the content/order of bindings
at creation time.

Example :
``` c++
DescriptorSetBindings binds;

binds.addBinding( VIEW_BINDING, VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER, 1, VK_SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX_BIT);
binds.addBinding(XFORM_BINDING, VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_BUFFER, 1, VK_SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX_BIT);

VkDescriptorSetLayout layout = binds.createLayout(device);

#if SINGLE_LAYOUT_POOL
  // let's create a pool with 2 sets
  VkDescriptorPool      pool   = binds.createPool(device, 2);
#else
  // if you want to combine multiple layouts into a common pool
  std::vector<VkDescriptorPoolSize> poolSizes;
  bindsA.addRequiredPoolSizes(poolSizes, numSetsA);
  bindsB.addRequiredPoolSizes(poolSizes, numSetsB);
  VkDescriptorPool      pool   = nvvk::createDescriptorPool(device, poolSizes,
                                                            numSetsA + numSetsB);
#endif

// fill them
std::vector<VkWriteDescriptorSet> updates;

updates.push_back(binds.makeWrite(0, VIEW_BINDING, &view0BufferInfo));
updates.push_back(binds.makeWrite(1, VIEW_BINDING, &view1BufferInfo));
updates.push_back(binds.makeWrite(0, XFORM_BINDING, &xform0BufferInfo));
updates.push_back(binds.makeWrite(1, XFORM_BINDING, &xform1BufferInfo));

vkUpdateDescriptorSets(device, updates.size(), updates.data(), 0, nullptr);
```



## class nvvk::DescriptorSetContainer

nvvk::DescriptorSetContainer is a container class that stores allocated DescriptorSets
as well as reflection, layout and pool for a single
VkDescripterSetLayout.

Example:
``` c++
    container.init(device, allocator);

    // setup dset layouts
    container.addBinding(0, UBO...)
    container.addBinding(1, SSBO...)
    container.initLayout();

    // allocate descriptorsets
    container.initPool(17);

    // update descriptorsets
    writeUpdates.push_back( container.makeWrite(0, 0, &..) );
    writeUpdates.push_back( container.makeWrite(0, 1, &..) );
    writeUpdates.push_back( container.makeWrite(1, 0, &..) );
    writeUpdates.push_back( container.makeWrite(1, 1, &..) );
    writeUpdates.push_back( container.makeWrite(2, 0, &..) );
    writeUpdates.push_back( container.makeWrite(2, 1, &..) );
    ...

    // at render time

    vkCmdBindDescriptorSets(cmd, GRAPHICS, pipeLayout, 1, 1, container.at(7).getSets());
```




## class nvvk::TDescriptorSetContainer<SETS,PIPES=1>

nvvk::TDescriptorSetContainer is a templated version of DescriptorSetContainer :

- SETS  - many DescriptorSetContainers
- PIPES - many VkPipelineLayouts

The pipeline layouts are stored separately, the class does
not use the pipeline layouts of the embedded DescriptorSetContainers.

Example :

``` c++
Usage, e.g.SETS = 2, PIPES = 2

container.init(device, allocator);

// setup dset layouts
container.at(0).addBinding(0, UBO...)
container.at(0).addBinding(1, SSBO...)
container.at(0).initLayout();
container.at(1).addBinding(0, COMBINED_SAMPLER...)
container.at(1).initLayout();

// pipe 0 uses set 0 alone
container.initPipeLayout(0, 1);
// pipe 1 uses sets 0, 1
container.initPipeLayout(1, 2);

// allocate descriptorsets
container.at(0).initPool(1);
container.at(1).initPool(16);

// update descriptorsets

writeUpdates.push_back(container.at(0).makeWrite(0, 0, &..));
writeUpdates.push_back(container.at(0).makeWrite(0, 1, &..));
writeUpdates.push_back(container.at(1).makeWrite(0, 0, &..));
writeUpdates.push_back(container.at(1).makeWrite(1, 0, &..));
writeUpdates.push_back(container.at(1).makeWrite(2, 0, &..));
...

// at render time

vkCmdBindDescriptorSets(cmd, GRAPHICS, container.getPipeLayout(0), 0, 1, container.at(0).getSets());
..
vkCmdBindDescriptorSets(cmd, GRAPHICS, container.getPipeLayout(1), 1, 1, container.at(1).getSets(7));
```

# memallocator_dedicated_vk.hpp

<a name="memallocator_dedicated_vkhpp"></a>
## class nvvk::DedicatedMemoryAllocator
 nvvk::DedicatedMemoryAllocator is a simple implementation of the MemAllocator interface, using
one vkDeviceMemory allocation per allocMemory() call. The simplicity of the implementation is
bought with potential slowness (vkAllocateMemory tends to be very slow) and running
out of operating system resources quickly (as some OSs limit the number of physical
memory allocations per process).

nvvk::MemHandle represents a memory allocation or sub-allocation from the
generic nvvk::MemAllocator interface. Ideally use `nvvk::NullMemHandle` for
setting to 'NULL'. MemHandle may change to a non-pointer type in future.

\class nvvk::MemAllocateInfo

nvvk::MemAllocateInfo is collecting almost all parameters a Vulkan allocation could potentially need.
This keeps MemAllocator's interface simple and extensible.



## class nvvk::MemAllocator

 nvvk::MemAllocator is a Vulkan memory allocator interface extensively used by ResourceAllocator.
 It provides means to allocate, free, map and unmap pieces of Vulkan device memory.
 Concrete implementations derive from nvvk::MemoryAllocator.
 They can implement the allocator dunctionality themselves or act as an adapter to another
 memory allocator implementation.

 A nvvk::MemAllocator hands out opaque 'MemHandles'. The implementation of the MemAllocator interface
 may chose any type of payload to store in a MemHandle. A MemHandle's relevant information can be 
 retrieved via getMemoryInfo().

# memorymanagement_vk.hpp

<a name="memorymanagement_vkhpp"></a>
## functions in nvvk

* getMemoryInfo : fills the VkMemoryAllocateInfo based on device's memory properties and memory requirements and property flags. Returns `true` on success.



## class nvvk::DeviceMemoryAllocator

The nvvk::DeviceMemoryAllocator allocates and manages device memory in fixed-size memory blocks.
It implements the nvvk::MemAllocator interface.

It sub-allocates from the blocks, and can re-use memory if it finds empty
regions. Because of the fixed-block usage, you can directly create resources
and don't need a phase to compute the allocation sizes first.

It will create compatible chunks according to the memory requirements and
usage flags. Therefore you can easily create mappable host allocations
and delete them after usage, without inferring device-side allocations.

An `AllocationID` is returned rather than the allocation details directly, which
one can query separately.

Several utility functions are provided to handle the binding of memory
directly with the resource creation of buffers, images and acceleration
structures. These utilities also make implicit use of Vulkan's dedicated
allocation mechanism.

We recommend the use of the nvvk::ResourceAllocator class, 
rather than the various create functions provided here, as we may deprecate them.

> **WARNING** : The memory manager serves as proof of concept for some key concepts
> however it is not meant for production use and it currently lacks de-fragmentation logic
> as well. You may want to look at [VMA](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)
> for a more production-focused solution.

You can derive from this class and overload a few functions to alter the
chunk allocation behavior.

Example :
``` c++
nvvk::DeviceMemoryAllocator memAllocator;

memAllocator.init(device, physicalDevice);

// low-level
aid = memAllocator.alloc(memRequirements,...);
...
memAllocator.free(aid);

// utility wrapper
buffer = memAllocator.createBuffer(bufferSize, bufferUsage, bufferAid);
...
memAllocator.free(bufferAid);


// It is also possible to not track individual resources
// and free everything in one go. However, this is
// not recommended for general purpose use.

bufferA = memAllocator.createBuffer(sizeA, usageA);
bufferB = memAllocator.createBuffer(sizeB, usageB);
...
memAllocator.freeAll();

```

# pipeline_vk.hpp

<a name="pipeline_vkhpp"></a>
## functions in nvvk

- nvprintPipelineStats : prints stats of the pipeline using VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties (don't forget to enable extension and set VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_CAPTURE_STATISTICS_BIT_KHR)
- dumpPipelineStats    : dumps stats of the pipeline using VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties to a text file (don't forget to enable extension and set VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_CAPTURE_STATISTICS_BIT_KHR)
- dumpPipelineBinCodes : dumps shader binaries using VK_KHR_pipeline_executable_properties to multiple binary files (don't forget to enable extension and set VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_CAPTURE_INTERNAL_REPRESENTATIONS_BIT_KHR)



## struct nvvk::GraphicsPipelineState

Most graphic pipelines have similar states, therefore the helper `GraphicsPipelineStage` holds all the elements and 
initialize the structures with the proper default values, such as the primitive type, `PipelineColorBlendAttachmentState` 
with their mask, `DynamicState` for viewport and scissor, adjust depth test if enabled, line width to 1 pixel, for 
example. 

nvvk::GraphicsPipelineState structure is instantiated using C++ Vulkan objects if VULKAN_HPP is defined, and C otherwise.

Example of usage :
``` c++
nvvk::GraphicsPipelineState pipelineState();
pipelineState.depthStencilState.setDepthTestEnable(true);
pipelineState.rasterizationState.setCullMode(vk::CullModeFlagBits::eNone);
pipelineState.addBindingDescription({0, sizeof(Vertex)});
pipelineState.addAttributeDescriptions ({
    {0, 0, vk::Format::eR32G32B32Sfloat, static_cast<uint32_t>(offsetof(Vertex, pos))},
    {1, 0, vk::Format::eR32G32B32Sfloat, static_cast<uint32_t>(offsetof(Vertex, nrm))},
    {2, 0, vk::Format::eR32G32B32Sfloat, static_cast<uint32_t>(offsetof(Vertex, col))}});
```



## struct nvvk::GraphicsPipelineGenerator

The graphics pipeline generator takes a GraphicsPipelineState object and pipeline-specific information such as 
the render pass and pipeline layout to generate the final pipeline. 

nvvk::GraphicsPipelineGenerator structure is instantiated using C++ Vulkan objects if VULKAN_HPP is defined, and C otherwise.

Example of usage :
``` c++
nvvk::GraphicsPipelineState pipelineState();
...
nvvk::GraphicsPipelineGenerator pipelineGenerator(m_device, m_pipelineLayout, m_renderPass, pipelineState);
pipelineGenerator.addShader(readFile("spv/vert_shader.vert.spv"), VkShaderStageFlagBits::eVertex);
pipelineGenerator.addShader(readFile("spv/frag_shader.frag.spv"), VkShaderStageFlagBits::eFragment);

m_pipeline = pipelineGenerator.createPipeline();
```



## class nvvk::GraphicsPipelineGeneratorCombined

In some cases the application may have each state associated to a single pipeline. For convenience, 
nvvk::GraphicsPipelineGeneratorCombined combines both the state and generator into a single object.

Example of usage :
``` c++
nvvk::GraphicsPipelineGeneratorCombined pipelineGenerator(m_device, m_pipelineLayout, m_renderPass);
pipelineGenerator.depthStencilState.setDepthTestEnable(true);
pipelineGenerator.rasterizationState.setCullMode(vk::CullModeFlagBits::eNone);
pipelineGenerator.addBindingDescription({0, sizeof(Vertex)});
pipelineGenerator.addAttributeDescriptions ({
    {0, 0, vk::Format::eR32G32B32Sfloat, static_cast<uint32_t>(offsetof(Vertex, pos))},
    {1, 0, vk::Format::eR32G32B32Sfloat, static_cast<uint32_t>(offsetof(Vertex, nrm))},
    {2, 0, vk::Format::eR32G32B32Sfloat, static_cast<uint32_t>(offsetof(Vertex, col))}});

pipelineGenerator.addShader(readFile("spv/vert_shader.vert.spv"), VkShaderStageFlagBits::eVertex);
pipelineGenerator.addShader(readFile("spv/frag_shader.frag.spv"), VkShaderStageFlagBits::eFragment);

m_pipeline = pipelineGenerator.createPipeline();

# profiler_vk.hpp

<a name="profiler_vkhpp"></a>
## class nvvk::ProfilerVK

nvvk::ProfilerVK derives from nvh::Profiler and uses vkCmdWriteTimestamp
to measure the gpu time within a section.

If profiler.setLabelUsage(true) was used then it will make use
of vkCmdDebugMarkerBeginEXT and vkCmdDebugMarkerEndEXT for each
section so that it shows up in tools like NsightGraphics and renderdoc.

Currently the commandbuffers must support vkCmdResetQueryPool as well.

When multiple queues are used there could be problems with the "nesting"
of sections. In that case multiple profilers, one per queue, are most
likely better.


Example:

``` c++
nvvk::ProfilerVK profiler;
std::string     profilerStats;

profiler.init(device, physicalDevice, queueFamilyIndex);
profiler.setLabelUsage(true); // depends on VK_EXT_debug_utils

while(true)
{
  profiler.beginFrame();

  ... setup frame ...


  {
    // use the Section class to time the scope
    auto sec = profiler.timeRecurring("draw", cmd);

    vkCmdDraw(cmd, ...);
  }

  ... submit cmd buffer ...

  profiler.endFrame();

  // generic print to string
  profiler.print(profilerStats);

  // or access data directly
  nvh::Profiler::TimerInfo info;
  if( profiler.getTimerInfo("draw", info)) {
    // do some updates
    updateProfilerUi("draw", info.gpu.average);
  }
}

# raypicker_vk.hpp

<a name="raypicker_vkhpp"></a>
## class nvvk::RayPickerKHR

nvvk::RayPickerKHR is a utility to get hit information under a screen coordinate. 

The information returned is: 
  - origin and direction in world space
  - hitT, the distance of the hit along the ray direction
  - primitiveID, instanceID and instanceCustomIndex
  - the barycentric coordinates in the triangle

Setting up:
  - call setup() once with the Vulkan device, and allocator
  - call setTlas with the TLAS previously build

Getting results, for example, on mouse down:
- fill the PickInfo structure
- call run()
- call getResult() to get all the information above


Example to set the camera interest point 
  ``` c++
  RayPickerKHR::PickResult pr = m_picker.getResult();
  if(pr.instanceID != ~0) // Hit something
  {
    glm::vec3 worldPos = pr.worldRayOrigin + pr.worldRayDirection * pr.hitT;
    glm::vec3 eye, center, up;
    CameraManip.getLookat(eye, center, up);
    CameraManip.setLookat(eye, worldPos, up, false); // Nice with CameraManip.updateAnim();
  }
  ```

# raytraceKHR_vk.hpp

<a name="raytraceKHR_vkhpp"></a>
## class nvvk::RaytracingBuilderKHR

> nvvk::RaytracingBuilderKHR is a base functionality of raytracing

This class acts as an owning container for a single top-level acceleration
structure referencing any number of bottom-level acceleration structures.
We provide functions for building (on the device) an array of BLASs and a
single TLAS from vectors of BlasInput and Instance, respectively, and
a destroy function for cleaning up the created acceleration structures.

Generally, we reference BLASs by their index in the stored BLAS array,
rather than using raw device pointers as the pure Vulkan acceleration
structure API uses.

This class does not support replacing acceleration structures once
built, but you can update the acceleration structures. For educational
purposes, this class prioritizes (relative) understandability over
performance, so vkQueueWaitIdle is implicitly used everywhere.

## Setup and Usage
``` c++
// Borrow a VkDevice and memory allocator pointer (must remain
// valid throughout our use of the ray trace builder), and
// instantiate an unspecified queue of the given family for use.
m_rtBuilder.setup(device, memoryAllocator, queueIndex);

// You create a vector of RayTracingBuilderKHR::BlasInput then
// pass it to buildBlas.
std::vector<RayTracingBuilderKHR::BlasInput> inputs = // ...
m_rtBuilder.buildBlas(inputs);

// You create a vector of RaytracingBuilder::Instance and pass to
// buildTlas. The blasId member of each instance must be below
// inputs.size() (above).
std::vector<VkAccelerationStructureInstanceKHR> instances = // ...
m_rtBuilder.buildTlas(instances);

// Retrieve the handle to the acceleration structure.
const VkAccelerationStructureKHR tlas = m.rtBuilder.getAccelerationStructure()
```

# resourceallocator_vk.hpp

<a name="resourceallocator_vkhpp"></a>
## class nvvk::ResourceAllocatorDedicated)
 * [ResourceAllocatorDma](#class nvvk::ResourceAllocatorDma)
 * [ResourceAllocatorVma](#cass nvvk::ResourceAllocatorVma)
 
 In these cases, only one object needs to be created and initialized. 
 
 ResourceAllocator can also be subclassed to specialize some of its functionality.
 Examples are [ExportResourceAllocator](#class ExportResourceAllocator) and [ExplicitDeviceMaskResourceAllocator](#class ExplicitDeviceMaskResourceAllocator).
 ExportResourceAllocator injects itself into the object allocation process such that 
 the resulting allocations can be exported or created objects may be bound to exported
 memory
 ExplicitDeviceMaskResourceAllocator overrides the devicemask of allocations such that
 objects can be created on a specific device in a device group.
 


## class nvvk::ResourceAllocator

The goal of nvvk::ResourceAllocator is to aid creation of typical Vulkan
resources (VkBuffer, VkImage and VkAccelerationStructure).
All memory is allocated using the provided [nvvk::MemAllocator](#class-nvvkmemallocator)
and bound to the appropriate resources. The allocator contains a 
[nvvk::StagingMemoryManager](#class-nvvkstagingmemorymanager) and 
[nvvk::SamplerPool](#class-nvvksamplerpool) to aid this process.

ResourceAllocator separates object creation and memory allocation by delegating allocation 
of memory to an object of interface type 'nvvk::MemAllocator'.
This way the ResourceAllocator can be used with different memory allocation strategies, depending on needs.
nvvk provides three implementations of MemAllocator:
* nvvk::DedicatedMemoryAllocator is using a very simple allocation scheme, one VkDeviceMemory object per allocation.
  This strategy is only useful for very simple applications due to the overhead of vkAllocateMemory and 
  an implementation dependent bounded number of vkDeviceMemory allocations possible.
* nvvk::DMAMemoryAllocator delegates memory requests to a 'nvvk:DeviceMemoryAllocator',
  as an example implemention of a suballocator
* nvvk::VMAMemoryAllocator delegates memory requests to a [Vulkan Memory Allocator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)

Utility wrapper structs contain the appropriate Vulkan resource and the
appropriate nvvk::MemHandle :

- nvvk::Buffer
- nvvk::Image
- nvvk::Texture  contains VkImage and VkImageView as well as an 
  optional VkSampler stored witin VkDescriptorImageInfo
- nvvk::AccelNV
- nvvk::AccelKHR

nvvk::Buffer, nvvk::Image, nvvk::Texture and nvvk::AccelKHR nvvk::AccelNV objects can be copied
by value. They do not track lifetime of the underlying Vulkan objects and memory allocations. 
The corresponding destroy() functions of nvvk::ResourceAllocator destroy created objects and
free up their memory. ResourceAllocator does not track usage of objects either. Thus, one has to
make sure that objects are no longer in use by the GPU when they get destroyed.

> Note: These classes are foremost to showcase principle components that
> a Vulkan engine would most likely have.
> They are geared towards ease of use in this sample framework, and 
> not optimized nor meant for production code.

``` c++
nvvk::DeviceMemoryAllocator memAllocator;
nvvk::ResourceAllocator     resAllocator;

memAllocator.init(device, physicalDevice);
resAllocator.init(device, physicalDevice, &memAllocator);

...

VkCommandBuffer cmd = ... transfer queue command buffer

// creates new resources and 
// implicitly triggers staging transfer copy operations into cmd
nvvk::Buffer vbo = resAllocator.createBuffer(cmd, vboSize, vboData, vboUsage);
nvvk::Buffer ibo = resAllocator.createBuffer(cmd, iboSize, iboData, iboUsage);

// use functions from staging memory manager
// here we associate the temporary staging resources with a fence
resAllocator.finalizeStaging( fence );

// submit cmd buffer with staging copy operations
vkQueueSubmit(... cmd ... fence ...)

...

// if you do async uploads you would
// trigger garbage collection somewhere per frame
resAllocator.releaseStaging();

```

Separation of memory allocation and resource creation is very flexible, but it
can be tedious to set up for simple usecases. nvvk offers three helper ResourceAllocator
derived classes which internally contain the MemAllocator object and manage its lifetime:
* [ResourceAllocatorDedicated](#class nvvk::ResourceAllocatorDedicated)
* [ResourceAllocatorDma](#class nvvk::ResourceAllocatorDma)
* [ResourceAllocatorVma](#cass nvvk::ResourceAllocatorVma)

In these cases, only one object needs to be created and initialized. 

ResourceAllocator can also be subclassed to specialize some of its functionality.
Examples are [ExportResourceAllocator](#class ExportResourceAllocator) and [ExplicitDeviceMaskResourceAllocator](#class ExplicitDeviceMaskResourceAllocator).
ExportResourceAllocator injects itself into the object allocation process such that 
the resulting allocations can be exported or created objects may be bound to exported
memory
ExplicitDeviceMaskResourceAllocator overrides the devicemask of allocations such that
objects can be created on a specific device in a device group.



## class nvvk::ResourceAllocatorDma
 nvvk::ResourceAllocatorDMA is a convencience class owning a nvvk::DMAMemoryAllocator and nvvk::DeviceMemoryAllocator object



## class nvvk::ResourceAllocatorDedicated
 > nvvk::ResourceAllocatorDedicated is a convencience class automatically creating and owning a DedicatedMemoryAllocator object



## class nvvk::ExportResourceAllocator

ExportResourceAllocator specializes the object allocation process such that resulting memory allocations are
exportable and buffers and images can be bound to external memory.



## class nvvk::ExportResourceAllocatorDedicated
 nvvk::ExportResourceAllocatorDedicated is a resource allocator that is using DedicatedMemoryAllocator to allocate memory
and at the same time it'll make all allocations exportable.



## class nvvk::ExplicitDeviceMaskResourceAllocator
 nvvk::ExplicitDeviceMaskResourceAllocator is a resource allocator that will inject a specific devicemask into each
allocation, making the created allocations and objects available to only the devices in the mask.

for (auto it : textures) {
  VkSamplerCreateInfo info = {...};

  // acquire ensures we create the minimal subset of samplers
  it.sampler = pool.acquireSampler(info);

for (auto it : textures) {
  pool.releaseSampler(it.sampler);

# sbtwrapper_vk.hpp

<a name="sbtwrapper_vkhpp"></a>
## class nvvk::SBTWrapper

nvvk::SBTWrapper is a generic SBT builder from the ray tracing pipeline

The builder will iterate through the pipeline create info `VkRayTracingPipelineCreateInfoKHR`
to find the number of raygen, miss, hit and callable shader groups were created. 
The handles for those group will be retrieved from the pipeline and written in the right order in
separated buffer.

Convenient functions exist to retrieve all information to be used in TraceRayKHR.

### Usage
- Setup the builder (`setup()`)
- After the pipeline creation, call `create()` with the same info used for the creation of the pipeline.
- Use `getRegions()` to get all the vk::StridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR needed by TraceRayKHR()


#### Example
``` c++
m_sbtWrapper.setup(m_device, m_graphicsQueueIndex, &m_alloc, m_rtProperties);
// ...
m_sbtWrapper.create(m_rtPipeline, rayPipelineInfo);
// ...
auto& regions = m_stbWrapper.getRegions();
vkCmdTraceRaysKHR(cmdBuf, &regions[0], &regions[1], &regions[2], &regions[3], size.width, size.height, 1);
```


### Extra

If data are attached to a shader group (see shaderRecord), it need to be provided independently.
In this case, the user must know the group index for the group type. 

Here the Hit group 1 and 2 has data, but not the group 0. 
Those functions must be called before create.

``` c++
m_sbtWrapper.addData(SBTWrapper::eHit, 1, m_hitShaderRecord[0]);
m_sbtWrapper.addData(SBTWrapper::eHit, 2, m_hitShaderRecord[1]);
```


### Special case

It is also possible to create a pipeline with only a few groups but having a SBT representing many more groups. 

The following example shows a more complex setup. 
There are: 1 x raygen, 2 x miss, 2 x hit.
BUT the SBT will have 3 hit by duplicating the second hit in its table.
So, the same hit shader defined in the pipeline, can be called with different data.

In this case, the use must provide manually the information to the SBT. 
All extra group must be explicitly added. 

The following show how to get handle indices provided in the pipeline, and we are adding another hit group, re-using the 4th pipeline entry.
Note: we are not providing the pipelineCreateInfo, because we are manually defining it.

``` c++
// Manually defining group indices
m_sbtWrapper.addIndices(rayPipelineInfo); // Add raygen(0), miss(1), miss(2), hit(3), hit(4) from the pipeline info
m_sbtWrapper.addIndex(SBTWrapper::eHit, 4);  // Adding a 3rd hit, duplicate from the hit:1, which make hit:2 available.
m_sbtWrapper.addHitData(SBTWrapper::eHit, 2, m_hitShaderRecord[1]); // Adding data to this hit shader
m_sbtWrapper.create(m_rtPipeline);
```

# shadermodulemanager_vk.hpp

<a name="shadermodulemanager_vkhpp"></a>
## class nvvk::ShaderModuleManager

The nvvk::ShaderModuleManager manages VkShaderModules stored in files (SPIR-V or GLSL)

Using ShaderFileManager it will find the files and resolve #include for GLSL.
You must add include directories to the base-class for this.

It also comes with some convenience functions to reload shaders etc.
That is why we pass out the ShaderModuleID rather than a VkShaderModule directly.

To change the compilation behavior manipulate the public member variables
prior createShaderModule.

m_filetype is crucial for this. You can pass raw spir-v files or GLSL.
If GLSL is used, shaderc must be used as well (which must be added via
_add_package_ShaderC() in CMake of the project)

Example:

``` c++
ShaderModuleManager mgr(myDevice);

// derived from ShaderFileManager
mgr.addDirectory("spv/");

// all shaders get this injected after #version statement
mgr.m_prepend = "#define USE_NOISE 1\n";

vid = mgr.createShaderModule(VK_SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX_BIT,   "object.vert.glsl");
fid = mgr.createShaderModule(VK_SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT_BIT, "object.frag.glsl");

// ... later use module
info.module = mgr.get(vid);
```

# stagingmemorymanager_vk.hpp

<a name="stagingmemorymanager_vkhpp"></a>
## class nvvk::StagingMemoryManager

nvvk::StagingMemoryManager class is a utility that manages host visible
buffers and their allocations in an opaque fashion to assist
asynchronous transfers between device and host.
The memory for this is allocated using the provided 
[nvvk::MemAllocator](#class-nvvkmemallocator).

The collection of the transfer resources is represented by nvvk::StagingID.

The necessary buffer space is sub-allocated and recycled by using one
[nvvk::BufferSubAllocator](#class-nvvkbuffersuballocator) per transfer direction (to or from device).

> **WARNING:**
> - cannot manage a copy > 4 GB

Usage:
- Enqueue transfers into your VkCommandBuffer and then finalize the copy operations.
- Associate the copy operations with a VkFence or retrieve a SetID
- The release of the resources allows to safely recycle the buffer space for future transfers.

> We use fences as a way to garbage collect here, however a more robust solution
> may be implementing some sort of ticketing/timeline system.
> If a fence is recycled, then this class may not be aware that the fence represents a different
> submission, likewise if the fence is deleted elsewhere problems can occur.
> You may want to use the manual "SetID" system in that case.

Example :

``` c++
StagingMemoryManager  staging;
staging.init(memAllocator);


// Enqueue copy operations of data to target buffer.
// This internally manages the required staging resources
staging.cmdToBuffer(cmd, targetBufer, 0, targetSize, targetData);

// you can also get access to a temporary mapped pointer and fill
// the staging buffer directly
vertices = staging.cmdToBufferT<Vertex>(cmd, targetBufer, 0, targetSize);

// OPTION A:
// associate all previous copy operations with a fence (or not)
staging.finalizeResources( fence );
..
// every once in a while call
staging.releaseResources();
// this will release all those without fence, or those
// who had a fence that completed (but never manual SetIDs, see next).

// OPTION B
// alternatively manage the resource release yourself.
// The SetID represents the staging resources
// since any last finalize.
sid = staging.finalizeResourceSet();

... 
// You need to ensure these transfers and their staging
// data access completed yourself prior releasing the set.
//
// This is particularly useful for managing downloads from
// device. The "from" functions return a pointer  where the 
// data will be copied to. You want to use this pointer
// after the device-side transfer completed, and then
// release its resources once you are done using it.

staging.releaseResourceSet(sid);

# swapchain_vk.hpp

<a name="swapchain_vkhpp"></a>
## class nvvk::SwapChain

> nvvk::SwapChain is a helper to handle swapchain setup and use

In Vulkan, we have to use `VkSwapchainKHR` to request a swap chain
(front and back buffers) from the operating system and manually
synchronize our and OS's access to the images within the swap chain.
This helper abstracts that process.

For each swap chain image there is an ImageView, and one read and write
semaphore synchronizing it (see `SwapChainAcquireState`).

To start, you need to call `init`, then `update` with the window's
initial framebuffer size (for example, use `glfwGetFramebufferSize`).
Then, in your render loop, you need to call `acquire()` to get the
swap chain image to draw to, draw your frame (waiting and signalling
the appropriate semaphores), and call `present()`.

Sometimes, the swap chain needs to be re-created (usually due to
window resizes). `nvvk::SwapChain` detects this automatically and
re-creates the swap chain for you. Every new swap chain is assigned a
unique ID (`getChangeID()`), allowing you to detect swap chain
re-creations. This usually triggers a `VkDeviceWaitIdle`; however, if
this is not appropriate, see `setWaitQueue()`.

Finally, there is a utility function to setup the image transitions
from VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED to VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR,
which is the format an image must be in before it is presented.

Example in combination with nvvk::Context :

* get the window handle
* create its related surface
* make sure the Queue is the one we need to render in this surface

``` c++
// could {.cpp}be arguments of a function/method :
nvvk::Context ctx;
NVPWindow     win;
...

// get the surface of the window in which to render
VkWin32SurfaceCreateInfoKHR createInfo = {};
... populate the fields of createInfo ...
createInfo.hwnd = glfwGetWin32Window(win.m_internal);
result = vkCreateWin32SurfaceKHR(ctx.m_instance, &createInfo, nullptr, &m_surface);

...
// make sure we assign the proper Queue to m_queueGCT, from what the surface tells us
ctx.setGCTQueueWithPresent(m_surface);
```

The initialization can happen now :

``` c++
m_swapChain.init(ctx.m_device, ctx.m_physicalDevice, ctx.m_queueGCT, ctx.m_queueGCT.familyIndex,
                 m_surface, VK_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_UNORM);
...
// after init or update you also have to setup the image layouts at some point
VkCommandBuffer cmd = ...
m_swapChain.cmdUpdateBarriers(cmd);
```

During a resizing of a window, you can update the swapchain as well :

``` c++
bool WindowSurface::resize(int w, int h)
{
...
  m_swapChain.update(w, h);
  // be cautious to also transition the image layouts
...
}
```


A typical renderloop would look as follows:

``` c++
  // handles vkAcquireNextImageKHR and setting the active image
  // w,h only needed if update(w,h) not called reliably.
  int w, h;
  bool recreated;
  glfwGetFramebufferSize(window, &w, &h);
  if(!m_swapChain.acquire(w, h, &recreated, [, optional SwapChainAcquireState ptr]))
  {
    ... handle acquire error (shouldn't happen)
  }

  VkCommandBuffer cmd = ...

  // acquire might have recreated the swap chain: respond if needed here.
  // NOTE: you can also check the recreated variable above, but this
  // only works if the swap chain was recreated this frame.
  if (m_swapChain.getChangeID() != lastChangeID){
    // after init or resize you have to setup the image layouts
    m_swapChain.cmdUpdateBarriers(cmd);

    lastChangeID = m_swapChain.getChangeID();
  }

  // do render operations either directly using the imageview
  VkImageView swapImageView = m_swapChain.getActiveImageView();

  // or you may always render offline int your own framebuffer
  // and then simply blit into the backbuffer. NOTE: use
  // m_swapChain.getWidth() / getHeight() to get blit dimensions,
  // actual swap chain image size may differ from requested width/height.
  VkImage swapImage = m_swapChain.getActiveImage();
  vkCmdBlitImage(cmd, ... swapImage ...);

  // setup submit
  VkSubmitInfo submitInfo = {VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_SUBMIT_INFO};
  submitInfo.commandBufferCount = 1;
  submitInfo.pCommandBuffers    = &cmd;

  // we need to ensure to wait for the swapchain image to have been read already
  // so we can safely blit into it

  VkSemaphore swapchainReadSemaphore      = m_swapChain->getActiveReadSemaphore();
  VkPipelineStageFlags swapchainReadFlags = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT;
  submitInfo.waitSemaphoreCount = 1;
  submitInfo.pWaitSemaphores    = &swapchainReadSemaphore;
  submitInfo.pWaitDstStageMask  = &swapchainReadFlags);

  // once this submit completed, it means we have written the swapchain image
  VkSemaphore swapchainWrittenSemaphore = m_swapChain->getActiveWrittenSemaphore();
  submitInfo.signalSemaphoreCount = 1;
  submitInfo.pSignalSemaphores    = &swapchainWrittenSemaphore;

  // submit it
  vkQueueSubmit(m_queue, 1, &submitInfo, fence);

  // present via a queue that supports it
  // this will also setup the dependency for the appropriate written semaphore
  // and bump the semaphore cycle
  m_swapChain.present(m_queue);
```
